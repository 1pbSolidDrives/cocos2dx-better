cocos2dx-common
===============

Because I wrote more than one cocos2d-x extension so I found some code can be moved out as a common codebase.

Requirement
===========
cocos2dx-common project refers cocos2d-x project. You must clone cocos2d-x repository to a folder named "cocos2d-x", 
and then clone cocos2dx-common in the same parent folder.

Demo
===========
No demo provided for this project

How to use
===========
For iOS, just drag cocos2dx-common project into your project. For Android, just import cocos2dx-common module. 
If not clear, refer to demo code.
